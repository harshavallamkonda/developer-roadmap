# Style Modifiers
Style modifiers are descriptors that consistently produce certain styles. They can be used to add specific characteristics or artistic elements to an image. For example, style modifiers can include information about art periods, schools, materials, techniques, and artists. By combining these modifiers, you can create even more specific styles. Some useful style modifiers include “photorealistic,” “digital painting,” “cinematic lighting,” and “hyper realist” . These descriptors help guide AI models in generating images with the desired visual qualities.

In summary, style modifiers allow you to influence the artistic style of an image by providing specific instructions related to aesthetics, rendering techniques, and other artistic aspects.
